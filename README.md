# Get Beer - React edition

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Very much work in progress, but the idea is to implement the same app in Angular (mostly done already), React and Vue
to keep my knowledge of these frameworks and libraries up-to-date.

I'd also like to provide an easy template for junior developers to get started.
